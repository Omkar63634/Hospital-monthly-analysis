This README describes the Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard created in Power BI for visualizing and analyzing key operational metrics from the hospitalâ€™s emergency room. The dashboard offers comprehensive insights for the month of January 2023.


## Overview

The dashboard is designed to provide a clear, data-driven monthly view of hospital ER activity, enabling stakeholders to monitor performance, assess patient care standards, and make informed decisions. It consolidates multiple data categories into interactive charts, graphs, and summary cards.[1]


## Features

- **Patient Satisfaction:** Tracks the average satisfaction rating given by patients.
- **Patients Referred:** Number of patients referred to other departments or facilities.[1]

### Visualizations & Insights

- **Trends and Line Charts:** Visualization of weekly patient count and wait time fluctuations.
- **Patient Admission Status:** Horizontal bar chart showing count and percentage of patients admitted vs. not admitted.
- **Wait Time Distribution:** Donut chart illustrating how many patients waited <30 min or >30 min.
- **Patient Age Group Analysis:** Bar chart segmenting patients by age brackets (e.g., 0-9, 10-19, ... 100+).
- **Patient Gender Breakdown:** Donut/pie chart for male vs. female patients.
- **Department Referral:** Bar chart showing the number of referrals by department.

- Monitor bottlenecks and improve wait times
- Understand patient demographics and satisfaction trends
- Optimize staffing and resource allocation based on admission and referral stats
- Make data-driven decisions for quality improvement initiatives


## Customization & Extensions

The dashboard layout and measures can be easily adapted to:
- Support additional timeframes or departments
- Integrate extra metrics like outcomes or costs
- Provide drill-through details for patient-level review
